You *found* us, ***welcome!*** <br /> 
We're currently *re-building* the **`App`** 
to make it _much_ simpler! <br />
If you want to help us ***`Beta` Test*** our MVP,
please see:
[github.com/dwyl/**mvp**](https://github.com/dwyl/mvp/)


## Why? [![Start with Why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

We are building an `App` 
because no tool we found
solves our problems.

[Product Roadmap > Why Build an App?](https://github.com/dwyl/product-roadmap#why-are-we-building-an-app)

> “_The **price** of anything is the **amount** of **life** you **exchange for it**._”
~ Henry David Thoreau

**Time** (a *finite* amount it) 
is one of the few things we *all* have in common.  
Whether we like it or not, 
we each only have a ***fixed amount***.
It is our most precious ***non-renewable*** 'resource'.  
We need a *much* better way 
of keeping track of how we spend it.

## What?

A simple way to organize your life/work 
and track activities over time
so that you focus on what matters
and don't get distracted by what doesn't.
