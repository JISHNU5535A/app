## Why?

“***The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.***”
~ Henry David Thoreau

Time (a *finite* amount) is one of the few things we *all* have in common.  
Wether we like it or not, we each only have a ***fixed amount***.  
It is our most precious ***non-renewable*** 'resource'.  
We need a *much* better way of keeping track of how we spend it.
