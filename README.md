## Why?

“***The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.***”
~ Henry David Thoreau

Time (a *finite* amount of) is one of the few things we *all* have in common. <br />
Wether we like it or not, we each only have
It is our most precious non-renewable 'resource'. <br />
We need a *much* better way of keeping track of how we spend it.

## What?

A simple way to track activities over time.
