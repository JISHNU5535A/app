> “_The **price** of anything is the **amount** of **life** you **exchange for it**._”
~ Henry David Thoreau

Time (a *finite* amount it) is one of the few things we *all* have in common.  
Whether we like it or not, we each only have a ***fixed amount***.  
It is our most precious ***non-renewable*** 'resource'.  
We need a *much* better way of keeping track of how we spend it.
