Experiments in Time. JavaScript, CoffeeScript and Mocha

Firstly, If you don't already know CoffeeScript (*shame on you*! :-P )
Here are a few resources:

- (Interactive) Online Book: http://autotelicum.github.com/Smooth-CoffeeScript/interactive/interactive-coffeescript.html
- 30min Tutorial: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/rocking-out-with-coffeescript/

I still have not found a **complete beginners** guide to programming that focusses on **Javascript** *and* **TDD**.
