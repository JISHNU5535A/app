## Contributing Guide

These guidelines build upon the dwyl contributing guidelines, which can be
found at https://github.com/dwyl/contributing

This document adds to this process, detailing what we have found useful
during the course of developing our own application and giving a broad overview
of changes for people _already familiar with dwyl's contributing process_.

In time, the whole process will be rewritten for clarity and now that our focus
has moved away from working with clients.
